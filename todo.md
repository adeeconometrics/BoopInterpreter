Problems to solve:
- [ ] Find out a way to conviniently parse `std::any`
    - attempt: use `any_cast<decltype(obj.type())>()` -- not effective as `obj.type()` returns `std::type_info`
    - attempt: use `any_cast<auto>()` -- not effective as the compiler cannot deduce types 
    - suggested: use `std::variant` and `std::visit`
        - cost: cognitive overhead to implement template constructs which might require another translation unit
